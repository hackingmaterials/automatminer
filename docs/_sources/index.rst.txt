`Automatminer <https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer>`_ is a tool for
*automatically* creating **complete** machine
learning pipelines for materials science, including automatic featurization
with `matminer <https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer>`_, feature
reduction, and an AutoML backend. Put in a materials dataset, get out a machine
that predicts materials properties.

How it works
------------

Automatminer automatically decorates a dataset using hundreds of descriptor
techniques from matminer's descriptor library, picks the most useful
features for learning, and runs a separate AutoML pipeline.
Once a pipeline has been fit, it can be summarized in a text file, saved to
disk, or used to make predictions on new materials.

Automatminer uses `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ dataframes for all of
its working objects. Put dataframes in, get dataframes out.

Here's an example of training on known data, and extending the model to out of
sample data.

.. code-block:: python

    from automatminer.pipeline import MatPipe

    # Fit a pipeline to training data to predict band gap
    pipe = MatPipe()
    pipe.fit(train_df, "band gap")

    # Predict bandgap of some unknown materials
    predicted_df = pipe.predict(unknown_df)

Overview
--------

**Automatminer can work with many kinds of data:**

-   both computational and experimental data
-   small (~100 samples) to moderate (~100k samples) sized datasets
-   crystalline datasets
-   composition-only (i.e., unknown phases) datasets
-   datasets containing electronic bandstructures or density of states

**Many kinds of target properties:**

-   electronic
-   mechanical
-   thermodynamic
-   any other kind of property

**And many featurization (descriptor) techniques:**

See `matminer's Table of Featurizers <https://hackingmaterials.github.io/matminer/featurizer_summary.html>`_
for a full (and growing) list.


**Automatminer is designed to be easy to use and reproducible**

- Save pipelines which are portable across machines
- Fit a complete pipeline with 1 line of code
- Predict on new samples with 1 line of code
- Presets for easy setup

**Automatminer is automatic and accurate**

- No hand tuning required
- Comparable in accuracy to hand-tuned models in benchmark tests
